# gun.rs

Experiment with porting [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun) to Rust.

## memo

- 06/23/2021: First pair-programming with @amark. Try to flesh out the general ins and outs as well as learn Rust. Cut errors down to a few. I fixed the code for it to run and add comments.

- 06/27/2021: Add some code from @amark and refactor into dup module.

- 06/28/2021: Add dam, dup, gun, and message module that implements Message trait.
